# Commenter

An [Atom](http://atom.io) package for adding newlines while editing comments.

If you are editing a dockblock or line comment, this will add a newline within that comment instead of just a blank line.

## Usage

You may want to use [Docblockr](https://github.com/NikhilKalige/docblockr) instead, which has many more features for writing comments. This package just allows provides the newline functionality.
